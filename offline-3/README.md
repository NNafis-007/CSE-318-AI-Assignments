# Chain Reaction Game

A sophisticated implementation of the Chain Reaction game with AI opponents featuring multiple difficulty levels and heuristic strategies.

## Overview

Chain Reaction is a strategic board game where players place orbs on a grid to trigger explosive chain reactions. The goal is to eliminate all opponent orbs by strategically causing chain reactions that convert enemy cells to your color.

## Game Mechanics

- **Grid**: Configurable grid size (default 3x3, supports up to 9x6)
- **Players**: 2 players (Red and Blue)
- **Critical Mass**: 
  - Corner cells: 2 orbs
  - Edge cells: 3 orbs  
  - Center cells: 4 orbs
- **Chain Reactions**: When a cell reaches critical mass, it explodes and distributes orbs to adjacent cells
- **Victory**: Eliminate all opponent orbs from the board

## Features

### Game Modes
1. **Two Player**: Human vs Human
2. **Human vs AI**: Play against computer with configurable difficulty and strategy
3. **AI vs AI**: Watch AI opponents battle each other

### AI Difficulty Levels
- **Easy** (Depth 3): Quick decisions, suitable for beginners
- **Medium** (Depth 4): Balanced performance and challenge
- **Hard** (Depth 6): Deep analysis, challenging gameplay

### AI Heuristic Strategies
1. **Weighted Combined**: Balanced approach (1Ã—positional + 2Ã—strategic)
2. **Orb Count**: Focuses on orb count advantage
3. **Edge Corner**: Prioritizes board position control
4. **Strategic**: Advanced multi-factor evaluation
5. **Chain Reaction**: Emphasizes chain reaction opportunities

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pygame 2.5.2+

### Installation
```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd chain-reaction-game

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## AI Heuristics Explained

### Weighted Combined (Default)
Combines positional strategy with strategic evaluation:
- 1Ã— Edge/Corner control score
- 2Ã— Strategic evaluation score

### Strategic Evaluation
Advanced heuristic considering:
- Win/loss states (Â±10000 points)
- Vulnerability to enemy attacks
- Positional bonuses (corners +3, edges +2)
- Critical cell advantages
- Contiguous critical block bonuses

### Orb Count Difference
Simple strategy focusing on:
- Total orb count advantage
- Basic material evaluation

### Edge Corner Control
Positional strategy emphasizing:
- Corner cell control (+3 points)
- Edge cell control (+2 points)
- Board position advantages

### Chain Reaction Opportunities
Tactical strategy prioritizing:
- Potential chain reaction setups
- Enemy vulnerability exploitation
- Explosive combination creation

## Customization

### Adding New Heuristics
1. Implement heuristic function in `utils.py`
2. Add mapping in `src/core/ai_player.py`
3. Add enum entry in `src/config/enums.py`
4. Test the new strategy

### Modifying Game Rules
- Edit `Board.py` for core game mechanics
- Modify `utils.py` for move validation
- Update `src/config/config.py` for visual settings

### Extending AI
- Adjust minimax depth in difficulty settings
- Implement new search algorithms
- Add learning capabilities

## Performance Notes

- **Grid Size**: Larger grids exponentially increase AI computation time
- **Difficulty**: Higher depths provide better play but slower response
- **Optimization**: Alpha-beta pruning significantly improves performance
- **Memory**: Efficient board copying minimizes memory usage

## Development

### Code Style
- Type hints for better code clarity
- Modular design for easy maintenance
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clean separation of concerns

### Testing
Run tests with:
```bash
python tests/test_structure.py
```

### Contributing
1. Follow existing code style
2. Add type hints for new functions
3. Update documentation for new features
4. Test thoroughly before submitting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Import Errors**: Ensure Python path includes project root
